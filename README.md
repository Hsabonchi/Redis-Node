# Redis-Node 
 Redis with node App
<h4>Redis (Remote Dictionary Server)is a fast and efficient in-memory key-value store. It is also known as a data structure server, as the keys can contain strings, lists, sets, hashes and other data structures. If you are using Node.js, you can use the node_redis module to interact with Redis. This tutorial explains various ways of interacting with Redis from a Node.js app using the node_redis library. </h4>

- Redis is often the most popular key-value database.
- Redis typically holds the whole dataset in memory
- Redis has also been ranked the #4 NoSQL database in user satisfaction 
- Redis provides a data model that is very unusual compared to a relational database management system (RDBMS).
- data must be stored in a way which is suitable later for fast retrieval, without help from the database system in form of secondary indexes, aggregations or other common features of traditional RDBMS

#### Installation

1. [Install Redis](https://redis.io/download) do not forget to run `make` command.
2. Change directory to redis  e.g `cd redis-6.0.9/`.
3. Run Redis with: `src/redis-server`.
4. Install node_redis, as you may have guessed, is the Redis client for Node.js. You can install it via npm using the following command. `npm install redis`


`Note that Redis doesnâ€™t support nested objects. All the property values in the object will be coerced into strings before getting stored`.

- Redis stores data in a key-value format
